## Example: Simulation and Fitting

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(KRR.withR)

# 1. Simulate simple regression data
set.seed(123)
n = 100
x = matrix(runif(n, 0, 1), ncol = 1)
true_y = sin(2 * pi * x[,1])
y = true_y + rnorm(n, sd = 0.2)

# 2. Fit KRR model
fit = krr(x, y, rho = 10, lambda = 0.01)

# 3. Predict on new data
x_test = matrix(seq(0, 1, length.out = 100), ncol = 1)
y_pred = predict(fit, x_test)

# 4. Visualization
plot(x, y)
lines(x_test, y_pred, col = "red", lwd = 2)
```
